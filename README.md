# Terms and Conditions popup
## **** Live Link:[ Terms and Conditions popup ](https://terms-and-conditions-popup.netlify.app/)******

**Common features for all users:**
* When a user visits the website for the first time, display a terms and conditions popup. There is some text and an   agree button. If the user clicks on the button, the popup goes down and is not shown in that session.
* I used here React library for frontend UI.
